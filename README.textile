h1. Robotlegs

Robotlegs is a lightweight AS3 MVCS micro-mrchitecture inspired by PureMVC. Robotlegs was created to provide a small, loosly coupled application framework that is easy to test. Where other frameworks are plagued with coupling and Singletons, Robotlegs has none. Bolier plate? Robotlegs avoids it. It is the framework youâ€™ve been looking for.
